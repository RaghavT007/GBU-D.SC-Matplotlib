# GBU-D.SC-Matplotlib
In this Repository, I have created a Matplotlib of Chhattisgarh State Covid-19 district-wise datasets which we have assigned as an assignment for our Data Science Subject, I have made this Matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook which includes different graphs and plots. I also uploaded the CSV dataset for future reference. 
Hope you'll like my work and find useful.

Note: Since this was the first time I have created Matplotlib Repository so feedbacks and suggestions are highly appreciated!

Thankyou......
